# UEE Tactical Communications Interface
UEE Tactical Communications Interface is a tool and fan project for tactical planning in Star Citizen, the game from CIG.

Currently, it's not being developed anymore but the source codes are open for anyone to play with.

1. UEE Tactical Communications Interface is an Open Source project and your contribution as developers is more than welcome through Pull Requests however I encourage you to discuss it with me first so that we wouldn't waste the time (@Aivii in Star Citizen Spectrum)

2. To cultivate the ideas into designs, go to the [board of InVision](https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/6B3D5QRKT2ZYM/). Don't hesitate to request the access to add all the ideas and designs describing how the vision of the best tactical tool should look like and operate.

3. To follow the project's progress, keep an eye on [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/yriIKmf7/u-tec-progress-board).
